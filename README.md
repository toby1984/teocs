# Set of crude Verilog definitions (hey, I'm a software developer) for components I use while working my way through "The elements of computing systems"

I decided to use Verilog instead of the HDL used in the book as I eventually want to run my homebrew CPU on some FPGA dev board. 

Dependencies:

I'm working on Ubuntu 19.04 and for the time being use Icarus Verilog (http://iverilog.icarus.com/) and gtkwave (http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).
